### python-flutterwave

- This lib aims to be the middleman between `Flutterwave API` and a python backend. Ergo, it directly makes the API requests to FW and returns the necessary info to the backend.

- One should thoroughly go through the [official docs here](https://developer.flutterwave.com/reference/introduction) in order to have a meaningful insight on how to use the params provided by the functions in the lib.

- The lib will also follow the same project structure as the official docs for ease of use and consistency.

- NB: Set `FW_SECRET_KEY` environnment variable obtained from the dashboard.

- Full package documentation can be accessed from [here](https://python-flutterwave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
